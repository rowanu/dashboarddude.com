    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Giraffe is great example of what's possible with a JavaScript-only dashboard on top of Graphite data.</p>

<p>Like many other Graphite dashboards, it's built on top of <a href="">D3.js</a>. It differs slightly because it's made with the <a href="http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/">Rickshaw graphing library</a> instead of using D3.js directly, which gives it some nice polish.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Stackable metrics.</li>
<li>One-click changing between (pre-set) time periods.</li>
<li>Customizable summary methods and display information.</li>
<li>Configuration is done with JavaScript objects.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Good For</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Browsing time periods</strong> is really easy. With one click you can see you metrics with fidelity from 10 minutes to 7 weeks (and a bunch of sensible values in-between).</li>
<li><strong>No server is required</strong>, so getting up and running is as simple as editing <code>dashboard.js</code> and opening the directory in your browser locally.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed example dashboards</strong> are provided, so you can follow along.</li>
<li><strong>Stacking similar metrics</strong> is a simple as using a wildcard or specifying multiple targets, and they'll all show up on one graph.</li>
<li><strong>Its summary details/legend</strong> can be shown/hidden as part of the display. It includes things like the range of values over the viewed time period, which is a nice time-saver for relevant metrics.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Not so Good For</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Viewing lots of metrics</strong> starts to eat a lot of RAM (regardless of how they're laid out). This issue is probably caused by Rickshaw (rather than Giraffe), but knowing that doesn't solve the problem.</li>
<li><strong>The layout doesn't use the all space available</strong>, which makes it less attractive as a monitoring dashboard. The config defaults to a 3-graphs-per-row layout, and while you can make graphs span multiple columns (even more than the default 3), I couldn't get the graphs to scale-out to my wide display.</li>
<li><strong>Fine metrics being compared to each other</strong> can be difficult to see because multiple metrics on one graph are stacked. Being stacked means that the ordering of the metrics is important, and it's not easy to change on the fly (you have to edit the dashboard configuration object). Note that you can toggle the visibility of metrics in the interface, but this still requires some manual intervention.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration is a bit complicated</strong>, but only because  there are a lot of options/aliases/etc. It's much easier to set up when you already have a clear idea of the metrics you want to display.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I would use this dashboard to quickly access and browse (historically) metrics that I know are important, but might not be my 'top' monitoring metrics.</p>

<p>I don't think I would use this as my main monitoring dashboard (ie. on a big-screen for everyone to see all the time) because of the manual intervention and fine-grained detail, but those extra details make it a good for specific metrics/tasks.</p>

    <updated>2013-11-09T18:00:00-03:00</updated>
    <id>http://dashboarddude.com/blog/2013/11/09/dashboard-tasseo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I lied. The first of my series of <a href="/blog/2013/09/09/dashboard-reviews/">dashboard reviews</a> is NOT on Dusk, but one of
Obfuscurity's other great dashboards: <a href="https://github.com/obfuscurity/tasseo">Tasseo</a>.</p>

<h2>Tasseo</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/obfuscurity/tasseo">Tasseo</a> is a small, lightweight dashboard that's good for throwing together a
useful monitoring dashboard in a minimal amount of time. It's built with
<a href="http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/">Rickshaw</a> graphs (themselves based on
the fantastic JavaScript library <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>) on top of a small
<a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> application.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Configuration for dashboards is done with simple JavaScript Objects.</li>
<li>You can set value thresholds for changing the colour of a graph from green
(default), yellow (warning), and red (critical).</li>
</ul>


<h3>Good For</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Getting up and running quickly.</strong> There's just enough configuration options,
but not too many. This can get you from the default Graphite dashboards (which
can be a bit hard on the eye) to a nice looking monitoring dashboard in minutes,
not hours.</li>
<li><strong>Showing specific, discrete metrics</strong> for a high-level operations dashboard.</li>
<li>Metrics you want to set visual thresholds for.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Not so Good For</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Displaying large numbers of metrics.</strong> The layout eats in to your total
space (if you want to display lots of similar metrics, look at horizon charts
like Dusk instead).</li>
<li><strong>Discovering new important metrics.</strong> Mainly because it doesn't show a large
number of metrics, you're unlikely to find out new key metrics while using
Tasseo.</li>
<li><strong>Viewing metrics in detail over time.</strong> There's no rulers showing you what
the values in the chart represent, so it can be hard to know what the exact
values were in the past. The current value is displayed numerically, so it's not
an issue if you're only interested in historical trends - not values.</li>
<li><strong>Zooming/investigating metrics on the dashboard.</strong> What you see is what you
get, but it's enough for a high-level monitoring dashboard.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://dashboarddude.com/blog/2013/08/16/dashing-dashboard-widget-challenge-the-hotness/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-16T14:49:00-03:00</updated>
    <id>http://dashboarddude.com/blog/2013/08/16/dashing-dashboard-widget-challenge-the-hotness</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/dashing-hotness-widget/hot.png" width="250" height="250" title="Hot hot hot!" ></p>

<p>The friendly <a href="https://twitter.com/davefp">David from Shopify</a> contacted me
recently about the <a href="http://dashing.challengepost.com/">Shopify Widget Challenge</a> that they're holding. I've
written about <a href="/blog/2013/01/23/dashboards-for-graphite">Dashing before</a>, and
I'm a big fan of its style and versatility.</p>

<p>It didn't take me long to think of some widget ideas, so I thought I'd share
what it took for me to enter the challenge with a basic idea.</p>

<p>You can see the resulting widget <a href="https://gist.github.com/rowanu/6246149">in this
gist</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>My Idea</h2>

<p>The idea I had was for a widget that changed colour, depending on the value it
is displaying - kind of like the Meter and Number Widgets that comes with
Dashing, but <strong>hotter</strong>.</p>

<p>My plan is for this to be a big, bold, colourful way of
drawing focus to metrics which need immediate attention (because something's
about to explode, etc).</p>

<p>It's worth noting that the Number widget actually has (undocumented?) 'warning'
and 'danger' values that can be set (which cause the widget to pulse), but these
require a status to be set on the data sent to the widget (from the job). I
wanted something that would 'just work' with numerical data, as it's a common
use-case I see.</p>

<h2>The Dashing Dashboard</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://shopify.github.io/dashing/">Dashing page</a> has the basic information
you need to create your own widget:</p>

<blockquote><p>Anatomy of a widget</p>

<p>an HTML file used for layout and bindings</p>

<p>a SCSS file for styles</p>

<p>a coffeescript file which allows you to handle incoming data &amp; functionality</p></blockquote>

<p>That combined with the <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/tree/master/templates/project/widgets">existing examples</a>
and the <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets">3rd party widgets</a> as
reference points means that there are plenty examples out there to learn from.</p>

<h2>My Widget</h2>

<h3>HTML Template</h3>

<p>The template I decided was appropriate was super-simple - this widget is really
only trying to convey a single value, so I based it off the 'vanilla' Number
Widget.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1 class="title" data-bind="title"&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 class="value" data-bind="value | shortenedNumber | prepend prefix | append suffix"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class="updated-at" data-bind="updatedAtMessage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This just shows the title (if present), value (in a shortened format, with
prefix and suffixes - if present), and finally a small 'updated at' message (as
most widgets in Dashing do).</p>

<h2>Styling with SASS</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/posts/dashing-hotness-widget/cool.png" width="250" height="250" title="Everything's cool" ></p>

<p>Dashing comes with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> support, which is another nice
touch by the developers.</p>

<p>I had originally hoped to auto-generate the colour spectrum for the widget
using some of SASS' <a href="http://nex-3.com/posts/89-powerful-color-manipulation-with-sass">advanced colour methods</a>, but
in the end I decided to keep it simple for this first version, and use a
palette created by <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/lover/nekoyo">Nekyo</a> called
<a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/56122/Sweet_Lolly">Sweet Lolly</a>. I found
this through the <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/">COLOURlovers</a> site, and grabbed
it because I really wanted something that went from green to red, with yellow
in the middle.</p>

<h3>CSS3 Transitions</h3>

<p>After reading this <a href="http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/transitions/">great description of CSS3 transitions</a>, I created the
required SCSS for my widget. In order to make the code a little more readable,
I included a
<a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#mixins">mixin</a> to
handle all the browser-specific directives:</p>

<pre><code>@mixin transition($transition-property, $transition-time, $method) {
  -webkit-transition: $transition-property $transition-time $method;
  -moz-transition: $transition-property $transition-time $method;
  -o-transition: $transition-property $transition-time $method;
  transition: $transition-property $transition-time $method;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which meant that when I wanted to transition the background-color for my
widget, all I need to include in the SCSS is:</p>

<pre><code>@include transition(background-color, 1s, linear);
</code></pre>

<p>This might be a bit of overkill for the one usage, originally considered
some other transitions (and may still include them in a future version), so I
'did it right' the first time.</p>

<h3>CoffeeScript Functionality</h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/dashing-hotness-widget/neutral.png" width="250" height="250"></p>

<p>The widget functionality resides in a CoffeeScript/JavaScript file, which will
be included by Dashing at runtime. All of the included widgets are written in
CoffeeScript, so I wanted to keep consistent with that. I'm also a big fan of
CoffeeScript - I find it a bit more maintainable than JavaScript, especially for
small files like this.</p>

<h4>The onData Event</h4>

<p>In my basic widget, all of the magic happens in the <code>onData</code> event, which all widgets
receive when (surprise surprise!) data is sent to them by the scheduled jobs.</p>

<p>All I needed to do was change (toggle) the background colour (using CSS) of the
widget to represent its place between two user supplied values: 'warm' and
'cool'. Anything outside those values will be shown as 'hot' and 'cold'
respectively (ie. the max and min colour values). Anything inside those values
will use an interpolated value from three possible choices (cool, neutral, and
warm).</p>

<p>There's also a <code>ready</code> event, which fires when the widget is first loaded (ie.
when the page is loaded). This could be useful to configure the widget in a
certain way, depending on user settings, etc.</p>

<p>Here's the <code>onData</code> listener that makes the widget work (in CoffeeScript):</p>

<pre><code>onData: (data) -&gt;
  node = $(@node)
  value = parseInt data.value
  cool = parseInt node.data "cool"
  warm = parseInt node.data "warm"
  level = switch
    when value &lt;= cool then 0
    when value &gt;= warm then 4
    else 
      bucketSize = (warm - cool) / 3 # Total # of colours in middle
      Math.ceil (value - cool) / bucketSize
</code></pre>

<p>It could've easily been shortened to a few lines, but I like taking a few extra
to make it nice and readable.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hopefully this will help you create your own widgets for Shopify's Dashing
Dashboard. You can see (and install) the widget yourself by checking out <a href="https://gist.github.com/rowanu/6246149">the
gist</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Kudos to the Shopify guys</strong> for making a cool piece of software, and making it
so easy to extend!</p>

<p>If you've got a good idea for a widget (and it's not after September 13th,
2013), you should enter the <a href="http://dashing.challengepost.com/">Shopify Widget Challenge</a>!</p>
