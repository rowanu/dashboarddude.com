## Custom Dashboards
I specialize in custom __web-based real-time metric dashboards__.

### Google Analytics
Google Analytics dashboards and custom reports are how many small businesses get
their first taste of dashboards. I can set up and configure your Google
Analytics to give you the best of your metrics.

## Data Analysis
Getting data in to a presentable format is only part of the battle when making a
good dashboard. Sorting through the avalanche of data available to us today is
the hard part. I can help you:

* Find key and related metrics

## Data Wrangling
On the way to a good metric dashboard, the hardest part is getting all the
different sources of data together in one place.

### Graphite
[Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) is an Open Source, highly-scalable real-time graphing system.
It's one of my favourite tools for metric trending from almost any source.

I can help with all aspects of Graphite, such as:

* Set up and configuration
* Optimization
* Hosted installation
* Front-end customization and dashboards
