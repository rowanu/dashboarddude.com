{% img right /images/dude.jpg 400 300 The Dude Abides %}

I'm Rowan aka. __Dashboard Dude__.

An Australian based in Montreal, Canada. I'm part developer, part systems administrator, part data nerd, and **all dude**.

I do web development by day, and dashboard design and consulting by night.

I came to dashboard design from a wide background of roles (support, operation,
and development) and industries (academia, finance, web development and 
marketing).

If you need help with gathering, analyzing, and presenting your data in a useful
format, check out my [services page](/services) and [get in contact with me](/contact).
