{% img right /images/dude.jpg 400 300 The Dude Abides %}

I'm Rowan aka. __Dashboard Dude__.

An Australian based in Montreal, Canada. I'm Part developer, part systems administrator, part data nerd, and **all dude**.

I do web development by day, and dashboard design and consulting by night.

I came to dashboard design from wide background of roles (support, operation,
and development) and industries (academia, finance, web development and 
marketing).

I think that web-based real-time dashboards are one of the _sweet spots in data 
analysis_ today. They are the point where the of data, it's analysis and
presentation come together to give value to its owners.

If you need help with gathering, analyzing, and presenting your data in a useful
format, check out my [services page](/services) and [get in contact with me](/contact).
