* Are you bored with the built-in Graphite dashboards?

* Need something **shiny and cool** to impress your (pointy-haired) boss?

* Want JavaScript dashboards but **don't want to learn JavaScript?**

*Pretend sales pitch aside*, I'm playing around with a side project that will give Graphite dashboards-as-a-service. It's goal is to make setting-up and using good looking, real-time reporting and monitoring dashboards a breeze.

<!--more-->

The first dashboards that will be available will be [Cubism](http://square.github.io/cubism/) and [Tasseo](https://github.com/obfuscurity/tasseo), with others to follow soon. It will work with any Graphite install that has CORS enabled, which means it can work with your own installation or a hosted solution. You won't have to open your Graphite up to the Internet either - it will work even if your Graphite is behind by a firewall.

If this is something you'd be interested in, sign up below to get updates when it's ready.
