In this new series of posts I will be reviewing (in detail) some of the more
popular real-time dashboards out there. Don't forget to sign up to the mailing
list **on the right** to get the reviews as they come out.

Most of the posts will focus on front-end dashboards for Graphite, but if there
are any other types of dashboards you think would be good to review just [send me an email](mailto:rowan@dashboarddude.com).
I will be doing a review of [Shopify's Dashing](http://shopify.github.io/dashing/), because it's one of my favourites.

The first review (coming soon) will be on on [Obfuscurity's](http://obfuscurity.com/)
newest dashboard: [Dusk](https://github.com/obfuscurity/dusk)
